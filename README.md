# QUB-Challenge-MSc-Graduation-Processor

Given the following MSc taught module scores in this filePreview the document develop an application with a suitable OOP solution to enable :

1. The reading of the file
2. The output to screen of the file contents for each student including calculating the overall taught average for each student (remember programming is double weighted) e.g.

Student no. : 10101011
First name : Jimmy
Last name : Joe
Module results 
Program : 58
Comp Found : 67
DBs : 59
Web : 76
Software E : 67
Average : 64
Classification : Not available
etc....


3. Classify each student based on overall average for each student: 

distinction 70 - 100
commendation 60 - 69
pass 50 -59
fail 0 - 49 
error < 0 or > 100

4. Output the classifications to screen e.g.

Student no. : 10101011
First name : Jimmy
Last name : Joe
Average : 64
Classification : Commendation

5. Create a graduation list in the format student number, first name, last name and classification e.g. 0101011 Jimmy Joe Commendation and output to a file named ListForGraduation.txt
